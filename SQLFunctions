******************************************

	1) SQL Built-in Functions
	
	***Two types***
	
	(1)Group  Functions (Multiple row)
	(2)Scalar Functions (Single row)
	
	***************
	
	(1)Group Functions ( can be applied to group of rows) 
	
	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;
	
	AVG()--- SELECT AVE(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;
	SUM()---SELECT SUM(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;
	MAX()---SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;
	MIN()---SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;
	COUNT()---SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES;

	(2) Scalar Functions (Single row)
	
	Character function
	Number/Numeric function
	Date function
